    "An activation record is a contiguous block of storage that manages information required by a single execution of a procedure. When you enter a procedure, you allocate an activation record, and when you exit that procedure, you de-allocate it. Basically, it stores the status of the current activation function. So, whenever a function call occurs, then a new activation record is created and it will be pushed onto the top of the stack. It will be in function till the execution of that function. So, once the procedure is completed and it is returned to the calling function, this activation function will be popped out of the stack.\n",

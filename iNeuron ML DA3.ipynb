    "i) Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation. This means that, inevitably, the amount of time a human needs to spend performing a specific task will decrease as the machine learning accuracy increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Indirect instruction is a student-led learning process in which the lesson doesn't come directly from the teacher. Instead, it is student-centered. The key is to have students actively engaged in the learning process, making inquiries, using critical thinking skills to resolve problems, and testing hypotheses for validation. This high level of active student involvement strengthens the connections to the learned concepts.\n",

    "1. Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "As its name suggests, Supervised machine learning is based on supervision. It means in the supervised learning technique, we train the machines using the \"labelled\" dataset, and based on the training, the machine predicts the output. Here, the labelled data specifies that some of the inputs are already mapped to the output. More preciously, we can say; first, we train the machine with the input and corresponding output, and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).\n",

It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. "

    "Different Types of Supervised Learning\n",
    "1. Regression\n",
    "In regression, a single output value is produced using training data. This value is a probabilistic interpretation, which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables. For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the output has discrete values based on a set of independent variables. This method can flounder when dealing with non-linear and multiple decision boundaries. Also, it is not flexible enough to capture complex relationships in datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classification\n",
    "It involves grouping the data into classes.  If you are thinking of extending credit to a person, you can use classification to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter. When the supervised learning algorithm labels input data into two distinct classes, it is called binary classification. Multiple classifications means categorizing data into more than two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Naive Bayesian Model\n",
    "The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. It is a method of assigning class labels using a direct acyclic graph. The graph comprises one parent node and multiple children nodes. And each child node is assumed to be independent and separate from the parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that contains conditional control statements, comprising decisions and their probable consequences. The output relates to the labelling of unforeseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the tree representation, the leaf nodes correspond to class labels, and the internal nodes represent the attributes. A decision tree can be used to solve problems with discrete attributes as well as boolean functions. Some of the notable decision tree algorithms are ID3 and CART.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random Forest Model\n",
    "The random forest model is an ensemble method. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees and outputs a classification of the individual trees. Suppose you want to predict which undergraduate students will perform well in GMAT – a test taken for admission into graduate management programs. A random forest model would accomplish the task, given the demographic and educational factors of a set of students who have previously taken the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Neural Networks\n",
    "This algorithm is designed to cluster raw input, recognize patterns, or interpret sensory data. Despite their multiple advantages, neural networks require significant computational resources. It can get complicated to fit a neural network when there are thousands of observations. It is also called the ‘black-box’ algorithm as interpreting the logic behind their predictions can be challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm developed in the year 1990. It draws from the statistical learning theory developed by Vap Nick. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM separates hyperplanes, which makes it a discriminative classifier. The output is produced in the form of an optimal hyperplane that categorizes new examples. SVMs are closely connected to the kernel framework and used in diverse fields. Some examples include bioinformatics, pattern recognition, and multimedia information retrieval."

    "The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning: Labeled data\n",
    "The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
    "Goals: In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is different or interesting from the dataset.\n",
    "Applications: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam detection, sentiment analysis, weather forecasting and pricing predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised learning is a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer personas and medical imaging.\n",
    "Complexity: Supervised learning is a simple method for machine learning, typically calculated through the use of programs like R or Python. In unsupervised learning, you need powerful tools for working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised learning models are computationally complex because they need a large training set to produce intended outcomes.\n",
    "Drawbacks: Supervised learning models can be time-consuming to train, and the labels for input and output variables require expertise. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods can have wildly inaccurate results unless you have human intervention to validate the output variables."

    "Machine Learning Steps\n",
    "The task of imparting intelligence to machines seems daunting and impossible. But it is actually really easy. It can be broken down into 7 major steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collecting Data:\n",
    "As you know, machines initially learn from the data that you give them. It is of the utmost importance to collect reliable data so that your machine learning model can find the correct patterns. The quality of the data that you feed to the machine will determine how accurate your model is. If you have incorrect or outdated data, you will have wrong outcomes or predictions which are not relevant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you use data from a reliable source, as it will directly affect the outcome of your model. Good data is relevant, contains very few missing and repeated values, and has a good representation of the various subcategories/classes present. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preparing the Data:\n",
    "After you have your data, you have to prepare it. You can do this by :\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting together all the data you have and randomizing it. This helps make sure that data is evenly distributed, and the ordering does not affect the learning process.\n",
    "Cleaning the data to remove unwanted data, missing values, rows, and columns, duplicate values, data type conversion, etc. You might even have to restructure the dataset and change the rows and columns or index of rows and columns.\n",
    "Visualize the data to understand how it is structured and understand the relationship between various variables and classes present.\n",
    "Splitting the cleaned data into two sets - a training set and a testing set. The training set is the set your model learns from. A testing set is used to check the accuracy of your model after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choosing a Model: \n",
    "A machine learning model determines the output you get after running a machine learning algorithm on the collected data. It is important to choose a model which is relevant to the task at hand. Over the years, scientists and engineers developed various models suited for different tasks like speech recognition, image recognition, prediction, etc. Apart from this, you also have to see if your model is suited for numerical or categorical data and choose accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Training the Model:\n",
    "Training is the most important step in machine learning. In training, you pass the prepared data to your machine learning model to find patterns and make predictions. It results in the model learning from the data so that it can accomplish the task set. Over time, with training, the model gets better at predicting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluating the Model:\n",
    "After training your model, you have to check to see how it’s performing. This is done by testing the performance of the model on previously unseen data. The unseen data used is the testing set that you split our data into earlier. If testing was done on the same data which is used for training, you will not get an accurate measure, as the model is already used to the data, and finds the same patterns in it, as it previously did. This will give you disproportionately high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "When used on testing data, you get an accurate measure of how your model will perform and its speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Parameter Tuning:\n",
    "Once you have created and evaluated your model, see if its accuracy can be improved in any way. This is done by tuning the parameters present in your model. Parameters are the variables in the model that the programmer generally decides. At a particular value of your parameter, the accuracy will be the maximum. Parameter tuning refers to finding these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Making Predictions\n",
    "In the end, you can use your model on unseen data to make predictions accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a)\n",
    "ii) AI and machine learning have gained a lot of popularity and acceptance in recent years. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation changed even more. During the crisis, we witnessed a rapid digital transformation and the adoption of disruptive technology across different industries. Healthcare was one of the potential sectors that gained many benefits from deploying disruptive technologies. AI, machine learning, and deep learning have become an imperative part of the sector. Deep learning in healthcare has a huge impact and it has enabled the sector to improve patient monitoring and diagnostics. Here are the top pathbreaking applications of deep learning in healthcare.\n",

    "\n",
    "iv) Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. There are simple linear regression calculators that use a “least squares” method to discover the best-fit line for a set of paired data. You then estimate the value of X (dependent variable) from Y (independent variable)."

    "Below are the major differences between guided and unsupervised learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data: Regarding the training data used in the two types of learnings, supervised learning uses labelled data while unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data. Labelled data is well defined and comes with tags, whereas unlabelled data is not well defined and does not come with tags.\n",
    "Feedback: In supervised learning, the model takes direct feedback, whereas, in unsupervised learning, the model does not take any direct or indirect feedback. The supervised learning models use feedback to check if the predicted output is correct or not.\n",
    "Output: In supervised learning, the models predict the output. In unsupervised learning, the models do not predict the output; they find hidden patterns in the data.\n",
    "Input: Supervised learning requires input data and the output to the model. In unsupervised learning, you only feed input data to the model with no output.\n",
    "End goal: In supervised learning, the model predicts the output for any new data. In unsupervised learning, the goal is that the model finds hidden patterns in the data.\n",
    "Supervision required: True to its name, supervised learning models require supervision during training. In unsupervised learning, the model does not require any supervision during training.\n",
    "Categorisation: The two main categories in supervised learning are classification and regression, whereas in unsupervised learning the main categories are clustering and associations.\n",
    "Use cases: Supervised learning finds use in those cases where the input and output correspond to the available input. Unsupervised learning is useful in those cases where only the input is available and you do not have the corresponding output.\n",
    "Results accuracy: Supervised learning produces highly accurate results, whereas unsupervised learning produces less accurate results in comparison to supervised learning.\n",
    "Close to artificial intelligence: You cannot consider supervised learning to be very close to artificial intelligence as the model predicts the output only after getting trained for each set of data. In unsupervised learning, the model learns on its own.\n",
    "Computational complexity: Supervised learning is highly complex computationally. Unsupervised learning is comparatively less complex.\n",
    "Number of classes: In supervised learning, you know the number of classes, whereas you do not know the number of classes in unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Algorithms: Supervised learning includes algorithms like linear regression, support vector machine, logistic regression, multi-class classification, Bayesian logic, decision tree, etc. Unsupervised learning includes algorithms like clustering, Apriori algorithm and KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) The most significant difference between regression vs classification is that while regression helps predict a continuous quantity, classification predicts discrete class labels. There are also some overlaps between the two types of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regression algorithm can predict a discrete value which is in the form of an integer quantity\n",
    "A classification algorithm can predict a continuous value if it is in the form of a class label probability\n",
    "Let’s consider a dataset that contains student information of a particular university. A regression algorithm can be used in this case to predict the height of any student based on their weight, gender, diet, or subject major. We use regression in this case because height is a continuous quantity. There is an infinite number of possible values for a person’s height.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, classification can be used to analyse whether an email is a spam or not spam. The algorithm checks the keywords in an email and the sender’s address is to find out the probability of the email being spam. Similarly, while a regression model can be used to predict temperature for the next day, we can use a classification algorithm to determine whether it will be cold or hot according to the given temperature values."

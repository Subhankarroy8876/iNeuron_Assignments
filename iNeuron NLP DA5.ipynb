The gradients carry information used in the RNN parameter update and when the gradient becomes smaller and smaller, the parameter updates become insignificant which means no real learning is done."

Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine's output and that of a human: \"the closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is\" – this is the central idea behind BLEU. BLEU was one of the first metrics to claim a high correlation with human judgements of quality, and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics."
